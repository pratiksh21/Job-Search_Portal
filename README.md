## Data Validation in the Job Class

The `Job` class in our Job Search Portal model is equipped with comprehensive data validation to ensure the accuracy and consistency of job data. Here are the key points about the validations applied to the fields:

### Job ID

- **Validation:** No additional validation (handled by database auto-generation).
- **Description:** The `id` field is auto-generated by the database and serves as a unique identifier for each job.

### Title

- **Validation:** None
- **Description:** The `title` field does not have additional validation constraints.

### Description

- **Validation:** None
- **Description:** The `description` field does not have additional validation constraints.

### Location

- **Validation:** None
- **Description:** The `location` field does not have additional validation constraints.

### Salary

- **Validation:** Minimum salary value of 20,000.
- **Description:** The `salary` field is validated to ensure it is greater than or equal to 20,000.

### Company Email

- **Validation:** Valid email format.
- **Description:** The `companyEmail` field is validated to ensure it contains a valid email address.

### Company Name

- **Validation:** None
- **Description:** The `companyName` field does not have additional validation constraints.

### Employer Name

- **Validation:** None
- **Description:** The `employerName` field does not have additional validation constraints.

### Job Type

- **Validation:** None
- **Description:** The `jobType` field is not subject to additional validation as it represents an enumeration of predefined job types.

These validations ensure that job data is accurately captured and meets specified criteria, contributing to the reliability and integrity of our Job Search Portal.

## Data Flow

### Controller

The Controller layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and delegating them to the appropriate services. It defines API endpoints for the following operations:

1. **Get All Jobs:** `GET /jobs`
2. **Get Job by ID:** `GET /job/{jobID}`
3. **Add a Job:** `POST /job`
4. **Add Multiple Jobs:** `POST /jobs`
5. **Update Salary by Job ID:** `PUT /job/{jobID}/salary/{salary}`
6. **Update Location by Job ID:** `PUT /job/{jobID}/location/{location}`
7. **Update Company Email by Job ID:** `PUT /job/{jobID}/email/{email}`
8. **Remove Job by ID:** `DELETE /job/{jobID}`
9. **Get All Jobs of the Same Type:** `GET /jobs/type/{jobType}`
10. **Get All Jobs with Salary Greater Than or Equal to a Value:** `GET /jobs/salary/{salary}`
11. **Get All Jobs from the Same Company:** `GET /jobs/company/{companyName}`
12. **Remove All Jobs from the Same Company:** `DELETE /jobs/company/{companyName}`
13. **Update Salaries of Jobs with the Same Type:** `PUT /jobs/type/{jobType}/updateSalaries`

```java
@RestController
public class JobController {
    @Autowired
    JobService jobService;

    // Define API endpoints for various job operations
    // ...
}
```

## Services

The Services layer implements the core business logic, data processing, and interaction with the data repository. Key responsibilities include:

- Validating input data.
- Performing CRUD operations on job data.
- Handling data transformations and interactions with the H2 in-memory database.

```java
@Service
public class JobService {
    @Autowired
    IJobRepo i

JobRepo;

    // Implement methods for job operations
    // ...
}
```

## Repository

The Repository layer manages data access to the H2 in-memory database. It handles database operations such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) for job data. Additionally, it may include data mapping and conversion between Java objects and database entities.

```java
@Repository
public interface IJobRepo extends JpaRepository<Job, Long> {
    // Define custom query methods for job data access
    // ...
}
```

## Database Design

The project's database design includes a table named "Jobs" with fields such as:

- `id` (Job ID): A unique identifier for each job.
- `title` (Title): The job title.
- `description` (Description): A description of the job.
- `location` (Location): The job location.
- `salary` (Salary): The job salary.
- `companyEmail` (Company Email): The email address of the company.
- `companyName` (Company Name): The name of the company.
- `employerName` (Employer Name): The name of the employer.
- `jobType` (Job Type): An enumeration specifying the job type.

### Jobs Table

| Column Name     | Data Type         | Description                        |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| id              | LONG (Primary Key)| Unique identifier for each job     |
| title           | VARCHAR(255)      | Job title                          |
| description     | TEXT              | Job description                    |
| location        | VARCHAR(255)      | Job location                       |
| salary          | DOUBLE            | Job salary                         |
| companyEmail    | VARCHAR(255)      | Company email address              |
| companyName     | VARCHAR(255)      | Company name                       |
| employerName    | VARCHAR(255)      | Employer name                      |
| jobType         | ENUM              | Job type (IT, HR, SALES, etc.)     |

The "Jobs" table stores job-related information, including job IDs, titles, descriptions, locations, salaries, company details, employer names, and job types.

This database design ensures data integrity and provides a structured approach to managing job information within the application.

## Data Structures Used

The project utilizes the following data structures:

### Job Class

The `Job` class defines the structure for job data and includes fields for job attributes such as title, description, location, salary, company details, employer name, and job type.

### JobType Enum

The `JobType` enum enumerates the possible job types, such as IT, HR, SALES, MARKETING, FINANCE, OPERATIONS, and CUSTOMER_SUPPORT.

### JpaRepository

The project uses the `JpaRepository` interface provided by Spring Data JPA to perform CRUD operations on job data.

### ArrayList

The project utilizes the `ArrayList` data structure to store and manage lists of `User` objects in various parts of the application. `ArrayList` provides dynamic sizing and efficient element retrieval, making it suitable for storing user records and performing operations on them.


These data structures enable the application to organize and manipulate job data efficiently while maintaining data integrity.
